# MTR Traversal Coursework

This is our submission for the 2nd year Data Structures and Algorithms module in our CS degree. We were tasked to create utilities for a user to find information about the Hong Kong train system, demonstrating our understanding of the content of labs and lectures (revolving around the Java Collections Framework).

We created a barebones implementation of a node and edge data structure that represents a graph. We chose this approach because the last functional requirement requires finding a path between any two stations, so it made sense if we were implementing a path finding algorithm (where we'd later choose BFS).
